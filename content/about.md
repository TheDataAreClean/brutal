# What is a **Data Communicator** ?

I combine my background in statistics, my strength as a communicator and my interest in solving a good problem to build transformative solutions that advance the understanding of data across product, research and storytelling.

For over a decade, I have collaborated with numerous impact-focussed organisations to solve complex data informed problems. Through this work, I have understood communication of data to key stakeholders as one of the biggest challenges of any data solution.

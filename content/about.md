# what is a **data communicator** ?

i combine my background in statistics, my strength as a communicator and my interest in solving a good problem to build transformative solutions that advance the understanding of data across product, research and storytelling.

for over a decade, i have collaborated with numerous impact-focussed organisations to solve complex data informed problems. through this work, i have understood communication of data to key stakeholders as one of the biggest challenges of any data solution.

The `og-image.png` and `favicon.png` in this directory are auto-generated by `build.py` (requires `pip install Pillow`). Do not manually place images here — they will be overwritten on the next build.

The seasonal accent colour (one of 12 Bengaluru bloom colours, based on the current month) is applied to both images at build time.
